# Silah Requirements Tracking

This repository is used to **track and manage high-level requirements** for the Silah project. It does **not contain any code**.

All issues in this repository represent **requirements** that may involve multiple teams, repositories, or systems. They are used to:

- Centralize requirement tracking.
- Provide visibility across frontend, backend, and other teams.
- Facilitate planning and discussion without cluttering code repositories.

## How to Use

1. **View Issues:** Each issue corresponds to a single high-level requirement on our software requirements specification (SRS).  
2. **Discussions:** Use the issue comments to clarify, refine, or discuss requirements.  
3. **Labels:** Issues are labeled by type, priority, and team responsibility.  
4. **Milestones/Projects:** Requirements can be grouped into milestones and will be used on a GitHub Project for tracking progress.  

### Notes

- This repository is **not for code**; please do not push code here.  
- Requirements may evolve over time; issues should be updated rather than duplicated.
